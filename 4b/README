lab4b.c: C source file that makes the lab4b executable
	Builds and runs on your embedded system.
	Uses the MRAA library AIO functions to get readings from the temperature sensor
	Samples a temperature sensor at a configurable rate, which defaults to 1/second and is controlled 
		by an optional --period=# command line parameter that specifies a sampling interval in seconds
	Converts the sensor value into a temperature which is, by default, reported in degrees Fahrenheit, 
		or in Celsius if specified with an optional --scale=C (or --scale=F) command line parameter
	Creates a report and writes to stdout for each sample that includes:
		time of the sample (e.g. 17:25:58) in the local timezone, and
		a decimal temperature in degrees and tenths (e.g. 98.6)
	Appends that report to a logfile if that the logfile is specified with an optional --log=filename parameter
	Uses the MRAA library GPIO functions to sample the state of the button; when it is pushed, outputs (and logs)
		a final sample with the time and the string SHUTDOWN (instead of a temperature)

Makefile:
	The default target makes the lab4b executable with compile-time error checking flags -Wall and -Wextra.
	The clean target removes the lab4b executable and the tar.gz tarball.
	The dist target makes the tarball for submission.
	The check target runs the smoketests.

README: Contains information about the files in the submission tarball
