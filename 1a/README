lab1a.c: the c source file that makes the lab1a executable
    The program puts the keyboard into noncanonical echo mode, 
    thus creating a character-at-a-time, full duplex terminal I/O.
    With the --shell argument, the program passes input/output between terminal 
    (the parent process) and a shell (the child process). The child process execs a
    shell and takes standard input from a pipe from the terminal and outputs to 
    the terminal via another pipe.

Makefile: 
    The default target compiles the lab1a program using GCC and 
        compile-time error checking flags -Wall and -Wextra.
    The clean target removes the executable lab1a and .tar.gz tarball.
    The dist target creates the tarball of the files for submission.

README: Contains information about the submission files in the tarball
