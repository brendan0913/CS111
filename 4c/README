	Accepts commands from network connection to server and outputs the report to server
	Opens a TCP connection to the server at the specified address and port
	Sends and logs my ID number
	Sends, processes, and logs newline terminated temperature reports over the connection

	Opens a TLS connection to the server at the specified address and port
	Sends and logs my ID number followed by a newline
	Sends, processes, and logs temperature reports over the connection

Makefile:
	The default target makes the lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls executables with compile-time error checking flags -Wall and -Wextra.
	The clean target removes the lab4c_tcp and lab4c_tls executables and the tar.gz tarball.
	The dist target makes the tarball for submission.
